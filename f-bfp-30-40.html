		<h1>Jumping Jacks</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Stand upright with your legs together, arms at your sides.<br>
			2. Bend your knees slightly, and jump into the air.<br>
			3. As you jump, spread your legs to be about shoulder-width apart. Stretch your arms out and over your head.<br>
			4. Jump back to starting position and repeat.

		<h1>Squat</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Stand with feet a little wider than hip width, toes facing front.<br>
			2. Drive your hips back—bending at the knees and ankles and pressing your knees slightly open.<br>
			3. Sit into a squat position while still keeping your heels and toes on the ground, chest up and shoulders back.<br>
			4. Strive to eventually reach parallel, meaning knees are bent to a 90-degree angle.<br>
			5. Press into your heels and straighten legs to return to a standing upright position.

			1. Sit with your knees bent out in front of you, feet flexed, and heels on the floor.<br>
            2. Hold your hands in front of your chest and lean your torso back until you feel your abdominal muscles engage.<br>
            3. Slowly twist your torso from right to left. Remember to keep your core tight (and breathe!) throughout.

		<h1>Bicycle Crunch</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Lie on your back on the floor, with knees bent, feet flat, and arms straight up.<br>
            2. Keep back flat on the floor as you slowly extend left arm and right leg. Maintain a strong core and keep your low back on the floor.<br>
            3. Return to the starting position, and then repeat on the other side to complete 1 rep.

		<h1>Leg Lift</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Press lower back into the floor. While lowering legs, stop once you feel your back lifting off the floor.<br>
            2. Keep legs together and inner thighs engaged.<br>
            3. Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way up.

		<h1>Glute Bridge</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Lie face up on the floor, with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Keep your arms at your side with your palms down.<br>
            2. Lift your hips off the ground until your knees, hips and shoulders form a straight line. Squeeze those glutes hard and keep your abs drawn in so you don’t overextend your back during the exercise.<br>
            3. Hold your bridged position for a couple of seconds before easing back down.

		<h1>Plank</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Begin on all fours, placing your hands on the ground directly beneath your shoulders.<br>
            2. Next, step your feet behind you, grounding down into your toes to form a straight line from head to toe.<br>
            3. Engage your legs, glutes, and core as you maintain a neutral neck and spine.<br>
            4. Hold for 30 seconds with good form.
