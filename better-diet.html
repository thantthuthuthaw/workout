	<h1>There is another way to lose weight</h1>
	<p>It is to starve yourself in starving, there are 2 categories. It is “diet” and “fasting”. Diet is “your habit of food every day” but nowadays it’s a food plan to lose weight </p>

	<h1>Fasting is "not eating for 12 – 24 hours"</h1>
	<p>Sometimes people do it for more than a day. Fasting sometimes comes with religious reasons, it’s rare for people to do it to lose weight Fasting is a practice that has been associated with a wide array of potential health benefits, including weight loss, as well as improved blood sugar control, heart health, brain function, and cancer prevention.</p>

	<h1>Diet and fast – starving yourself</h1>
	<p>How starving yourself work is when you eat less and starve yourself there is not enough energy to contain yourself throughout the day and when it happens your brain goes into survival instinct mode, what happens is it uses your stored fats and turns them into energywhen the starvation is longer the longer your body fat is used.</p>

	<h1>Fasting – starving yourself comes with a great result but comes with greater risks</h1>
	<p>Fasting can increase stress levels and disrupt sleep. Dehydration, hunger, or lack of sleep during fasting can also lead to headaches. Fasting can also cause heartburn; lack of food reduces stomach acid, which digests food and destroys bacteria. Biologically, dieting can lead to unhealthy changes in body composition, hormonal changes, reduced bone density, menstrual disturbances, and lower resting energy expenditure.</p>
