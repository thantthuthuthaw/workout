		<h1>Squat</h1>
		<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
			1. Stand with feet a little wider than hip width, toes facing front.<br>
			2. Drive your hips back—bending at the knees and ankles and pressing your knees slightly open.<br>
			3. Sit into a squat position while still keeping your heels and toes on the ground, chest up and shoulders back.<br>
			4. Strive to eventually reach parallel, meaning knees are bent to a 90-degree angle.<br>
			5. Press into your heels and straighten legs to return to a standing upright position.

	<h1>Side Plank Hip Lift <mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);">|Please do the both sides.</mark></h1>
	<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
		1. Lie on your left side propped up on your left elbow and forearm, shoulders stacked over your elbow, legs stacked on top of each other, and hold a dumbbell in place on top of your right hip.<br>
        2. Raise your hips so that your body forms a straight line from head to heels. This is the starting position.<br>
        3. Keeping your core braced and your glutes engaged, slowly lower your left hip, tapping it gently on the floor.<br>
        4. Reverse the move, returning to side plank position.<br>
        5. Repeat for reps, then switch sides, performing equal reps on each.

	<h1>Side Plank With Rotation <mark style="background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);">|Please do the both sides.</mark></h1>
	<b><big><p>Tips: <br>
		1. Start in a traditional side plank position.<br>
            2. Raise your top arm straight above you.<br>
            3. Then lower your arm and rotate your core as you thread your top arm through the space under you. Stop when your shoulders are close to being parallel to the floor.<br>
            4. Unthread your arm and return to the starting position.<br>
            5. Repeat for 10 to 15 reps and then repeat on the other side.<br>
            6. If you’re a beginner, aim for 1 set per side to start and work up to 3 sets per side as you gain strength.
